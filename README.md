COVID-19 Vaccination Data Analysis

A data science project exploring global COVID-19 vaccination trends using publicly available datasets. This notebook visualizes cumulative vaccinations, compares countries by vaccination percentage, and highlights key insights from the data.

 Objectives

- Analyze and visualize the global COVID-19 vaccination progress
- Compare vaccination trends across selected countries
- Identify patterns, anomalies, and key takeaways using interactive charts

 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python (Google Colab)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) — Data manipulation
- [Plotly Express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/) — Interactive visualizations
- [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/) *(optional)* — Geospatial data (for choropleth maps)
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) — Project interface
- Dataset: [Our World in Data - COVID-19](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations)

 How to Run / View the Project

1. Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or any Jupyter environment.
2. Make sure `owid-covid-data.csv` is uploaded or accessible in the working directory.
3. Run all cells from top to bottom.
4. For GeoPandas map: install GeoPandas via `!pip install geopandas`.

 Insights & Reflections

- Germanyhad one of the fastest early vaccination rollouts.
- India had very high total doses but lower % coverage due to population size.
- South Africa lagged in uptake, showing equity and access challenges.
- Some countries plateaued in vaccination progress — a potential sign of vaccine hesitancy.
- Interactive charts helped surface patterns not immediately visible in raw dat
